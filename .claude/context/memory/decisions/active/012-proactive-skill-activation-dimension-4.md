# ADR-012: Proactive Skill Activation (Dimension 4)

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: Accepted
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Context

User observed: "I notice you don't use your skills or agents, you just work on your own."

**Analysis revealed:**
- System had 20 skills
- Skills were defined with capabilities
- But skills were NEVER activated proactively
- Operating at ~30% capacity (generalist only)

**Root cause:** Missing Dimension 4 - Proactive Orchestration.

## Decision

Implement proactive skill activation based on task type:

**Two-Level Routing:**
1. **Intent Detection** → Load context files (UFC Layer 2)
2. **Skill Activation** → Activate specialist skills (Dimension 4)

**5 Critical Rules:**

1. **ALWAYS activate skills for specialized work**
   - Research → academic-research
   - Swedish content → swedish-content
   - Architecture → architecture
   - Coding → engineering

2. **Specialist > Generalist**
   - Skills have deeper knowledge
   - Skills have refined workflows
   - Skills have domain expertise

3. **Observable Activation**
   - MUST show: "✅ Skill activated: [name] ([voice])"
   - MUST show: "✅ Skill instructions loaded"
   - Transparency = Trust

4. **Voice Follows Skill**
   - Each skill has assigned voice
   - British voices → English text
   - Swedish voices → Swedish text
   - Neutral voices → Match user input

5. **[SKILL:] Tag in COMPLETED**
   - Format: `[SKILL:skill-name]`
   - Enables voice routing
   - Makes specialist work visible

**Capacity Impact:**
- Before: ~30% (Ogmios generalist only)
- After: ~100% (Specialists + Ogmios orchestration)

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ **100% capacity** vs 30%
- ✅ Specialists automatically engaged
- ✅ Higher quality output (domain expertise)
- ✅ Proper voice matching
- ✅ Observable behavior (builds trust)

**Negative:**
- ⚠️ More complex activation logic
- ⚠️ Need to maintain triggers in YAML
- ⚠️ Hook-based enforcement required

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
Complexity worth it for 3x capacity improvement. Better to use specialists than operate at 30%.

## Implementation

**Hook-driven activation:**
- user-prompt-skill-router.ts analyzes prompt
- Matches triggers from Tier 1 metadata
- Generates activation instruction
- Injects as system-reminder

**Observable verification:**
- Activation shown in response
- Skill instructions confirmed loaded
- [SKILL:] tag in COMPLETED message
- Voice routing based on skill
